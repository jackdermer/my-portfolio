      <p class="center">New York City ~ May to August 2020</p>
      <p class="center"><b>Founder and CEO</b></p>
      <p class="center">When my summer internship was cancelled due to Covid-19, I took it as an opportunity to start
        my own company. Camp Connect was a virtual camp for middle school children - offering one week long courses in
        STEM, design, and storytelling. In early May 2020, I assembled a team of 25 college students and for the rest
        of the summer, ran the company including developing courses, marketing to parents, and managing finances. By
        the end of the summer, we had 120 campers enrolled, developed 16 unique courses, and had a team of 32 college
        students working at the company.</p>

      <h2><b>THE IDEA</b></h2>
      <hr>
      <p>My three primary goals for Camp Connect were...</p>
      <ol>
        <li><h2>Create a fun, engaging camp for middle schoolers that makes for a memorable summer</h2></li>
        <li><h2>Provide parents with an affordable summer program for their kids</h2></li>
        <li><h2>Lead a team of college students in a fulfilling, collaborative start-up experience</h2></li>
      </ol>

      <h2><b>THE TEAM</b></h2>
      <hr>
      <p>While I had a vision for the company, I wanted to leave room for collaborators
        to contribute and make Camp Connect their own. I quickly knew the people to reach out to. I assembled an incredibly
        talented group of friends from middle school, high school, and college. There was a wide range
        of people - some who liked teaching, others who I believed would be great at marketing. Check out the
        <a href="https://www.2020CampConnect.com/about" target="_blank">About Us</a> page on our website to learn more
        about each team member!</p></p>

      <img src="../img/connect/meeting1.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" style="margin-bottom: 0px" alt="Responsive image">
      <p class="center"><b>Our first company meeting on May 18th</b></p>

      <p>After I pitched the idea of the camp, everyone was very eager to get to work! I setup sub-teams for people to
        join: course development, social media, finance, legal, school partnerships, financial aid, website.

      <h2><b>REMOTE LEADING</b></h2>
      <hr>
      <p>The first week of development was a blast, but very difficult. I was jumping between Zooms for 12 hours straight,
      working with each sub-team and making sure progress was being made. I knew that I could not sustain the level of
      oversight on each of the teams, so at our second company meeting I made improvements to our workflow.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Deliverables: </b>Given the amount of brainstorming that must occur, it is crucial that each team is taking
        meeting notes and uploading them to the Google Drive. In these notes, clear items should be assigned to each
        person and when they should be completed by.</li>
        <li><b>Ownership: </b>If you are assigned a task or are leading a group, it is your responsibility to see it through.
        With work being remote, no one is looking over your shoulder, so if we are to succeed you have to hold yourself
          accountable.</li>
        <li><b>Be Creative: </b>No one is an expert, so don't be shy about contributing. Everyone on the team is here
        because they can problem solve, so apply yourself!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Most of my leadership philosophy comes from my time as a Stage Manager in high school. I was responsible for
      leading teams of hundreds of performers and technicians, all fellow classmates. The most important point I learned is
        to <b>LEAD FROM AMONG, NOT ABOVE!</b> I applied this everyday at Camp Connect, looking to motivate my team and
      always being open to feedback.</p>

      <h2><b>MARKETING</b></h2>
      <hr>

          <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" src="../img/connect/ad1.jpg" >
        </div>

          <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" src="../img/connect/ad2.png">

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The primary goal of the marketing division was to enroll new campers. We developed several tactics...</p>

      <ol>
        <li>First we needed a brand image that would dictate how we presented ourselves. "We are a cool, passionate group
          of college students from top schools across the country"</li>
        <br>
        <li>We built our own website, focusing on making a concise overview of the camp and establishing credibility
        for the team behind it</li>
        <br>
        <li>All the team members reached out to friends and family</li>
        <br>
        <li>I reached out to my former middle school teachers who allowed me to present Camp Connect at a PTA meeting with
        80+ parents</li>
        <br>
        <li>We sent flyers and our website link to PTAs, principals, and teachers at middle schools</li>
        <br>
        <li>We contacted press outlets and were featured in <a href="https://www.timeout.com/new-york-kids/news/will-summer-camps-be-cancelled-these-virtual-offerings-will-run-051120" target="_blank">TimeOut NY</a> and <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/living/video/mother-son-pandemic-start-virtual-businesses-72630028" target="_blank">Good Morning America</a></li>
        <br>
        <li>I budgeted out money for advertisement. We primarily utilized Google, Instagram, and Facebook to boost brand
        awareness</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Besides the above tactics, we pursued many more, but what I believe made us standout was our video content. With
      my background in film, I directed numerous promotional videos throughout the summer that introduced a new courses
        and showcased the team...</p>

      <h2><b>COURSE DEVELOPMENT</b></h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Throughout the summer we developed 16 unique courses for our campers. Every two weeks we rolled out a four new courses
      to keep campers interested and re-enrolling. Here are some of the videos we created for the courses (click to play)...</p>

      <h2><b>THE HIGHLIGHTS</b></h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Camp Connect was an amazing experience! From the first company meeting in May to our last in August, I have grown as a leader.
      I was able to apply myself to the fullest - my video skills in marketing, my teaching experience, my leadership
      background from stage management. Above all my personal growth, nothing could top the end of each week of Camp Connect
      when we assembled all the campers for a camp-wide presentation. Seeing each camper present their project, whether
      it be a funky beat, a floor plan, or a piece of fashion, brought such joy to myself and the team. We were
      able to give these kids a summer that will stick with them forever. I couldn't be more proud of the team and
      what we were able to accomplish!</p>

      <p>What I learned from Camp Connect...</p>
      <ol>
        <li><h2>Marketing is key - convincing your customers to be just as passionate about your product as your are
        is a serious challenge. Marketing is a constant active effort that requires a strong understanding of your
        customers and your product</h2></li>
        <li><h2>Listen to your customers - feedback is crucial for improving the company and keeping customers engaged. Talking
          to parents and kids on the phone gave me valuable information on how Camp Connect should progress</h2></li>
        <li><h2>Believe in your team - as a leader, it is important that you trust your team members to accomplish tasks
        without your oversight. Independence will allow team members to apply themselves creatively, becoming collaborators
        rather than employees</h2></li>
      </ol>
